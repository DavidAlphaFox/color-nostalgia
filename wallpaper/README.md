# wallpaper

This is the wallpaper you see in the screenshots.

It was generated with [wallgen](https://github.com/mitchweaver/bin/blob/master/bin/wallgen)

## Setting

You'll notice the image is tiny. It's meant to be tiled.

I recommend [xwallpaper](https://github.com/stoeckmann/xwallpaper)

```
xwallpaper --tile "$PWD/color-nostalgia-wallpaper.jpg"
```
